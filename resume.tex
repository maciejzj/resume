\textbf{Machine Learning Software Engineer} -- Development and prototyping of
deep neural networks for image processing with Python, deployment on embedded
Linux devices with C++.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Involved in creation of \textit{U-Net} based artificial neural
		networks and utilization of \textit{nnU-Net} framework for clouds
		segmentation. Scored 53 out of 847 participants in competition:
		\textit{On Cloud N: Cloud Cover Detection Challenge}.
		Followed by several publications at \textit{IEEE} scientific conferences.
	\item Involved in \textit{super-resolution} tasks (single-image,
		multi-image, pansharpening) applied to satellite imagery, such as data
		generation, dataset curation, and super-resolution deep neural networks
		training including Transformer-based models. Followed by a publications
		at \textit{IEEE} scientific conferences.
	\item Curated and implemented deployment and benchmarking processes for
		several neural networks on an embedded Linux device with a custom
		hardware accelerator for aerospace equipment using \textit{Xilinx's Vitis
		AI} framework in Python and C++. Deployed the optimal solution to a
		satellite device. Followed by a publication in a \textit{MDPI}
		scientific journal.
	\item Curated and maintained in-house data processing and experimentation MLOps
		systems based on DVC, MLflow, and Jenkins.
	\item Involved in preparations and orations at various industry events such
		as \textit{Edge Computing in Space} and \textit{International
		Astronautical Congress}. Participated in international projects with
		multinational teams supervised by European Space Agency.
